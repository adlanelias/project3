# Project3 - PogChat
PogChat is an app that is inspired by Slack and Discord that I made in order to learn about realtime chat.

## Getting Started
Head over to this link to test out the live version: https://pogchat7.firebaseapp.com/

PogChat currently only works on web browsers, so you'll only need a computer in order to have access to the app.

## Current features
* Authenticated users
* Users can change their avatars
* Real time chat
* Shows who is online/offline
* User is typing message
* Emojis
* Image/Media sharing
* Global channels
* Direct Messages to all users of PogChat
* Search function for messages in a channel/direct message
* Colour Scheme choice for users
* Star a channel to save it in your favourite

## Frameworks and Languages used
* JavaScript
* React
* HTML/CSS
* Semantic UI
* Firebase

## Limitations
* Everyone on the database currently appears under direct messages
* Global channels are not user specific
* Only works on a fullscreen browser, can't be resized and work well
* Does not work on mobile
* Links are not clickable/don't turn up as a video, etc.
* Does not have a "friend" feature

## Future implementations
* Make it not show everyone under direct messages
* Make channels user specific - does not show for everyone without an invite
* Make a contacts/friends feature
* Voice chat between groups and direct
* Improve CSS to fit in all browser sizes and mobile
* Implement GIF support
* Let links be clickable and show up as a player if it is a video link
* Create user profiles
* Make usernames be unique
* Allow users to delete and edit their messages
